# Mars Rover

Building an interactive Mars Rover web application for self learning purposes.
This is the FE part of the repository, which connects to the BE via REST API.

Idea of the application is to:
- enter the min, max of the plateau (X,Y)
- enter the starting co-ordinates (X,Y)
- enter facing direction (N.S.E.W)
- enter the moving commands (F.B.L.R)
- fetch and display final position of the robot on the screen on submit

| **Direction** | **Commands** |
|---------------|:-------------|
|N -> North     | F -> Forward |
|S -> South     | B -> Back    |
|E -> East      | L -> Left    |
|W -> West      | R -> Right   |
